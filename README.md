# TLS-Wireshark-Decryption
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze and decrypt encrypted network traffic using Wireshark. The goal of this lab was to understand how TLS (Transport Layer Security) protects data in transit, and how security analysts can decrypt traffic legitimately using session keys for visibility during investigations, and troubleshooting.
